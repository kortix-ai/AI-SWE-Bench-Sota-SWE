ISSUE TO SOLVE:
<issue_description>
{problem_statement}
</issue_description>

AVAILABLE TOOLS:

1. FILE OPERATIONS:
   - view: View files/directories (can view multiple paths)
   - create_file: Create new file with content
   - replace_string: Replace specific string in file (REQUIRED for ALL code modifications)
   - update_file: Update entire file content (Use ONLY when explicitly required)

2. TERMINAL OPERATIONS:
   - bash: Execute commands and see output in terminal session

3. COMPLETION:
   - submit: Use only when 100% confident fix is complete

TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:
1. File Modifications:
   - First view files to understand content
   - Then use ONLY replace_string for changes
   - Format: replace_string(file_path, old_string, new_string)
   - NEVER create patch files or diffs

2. Testing Changes:
   - Create test with create_file
   - Run test with bash command
   - Check output in terminal session

3. Multiple Operations:
   - Chain multiple replace_string calls for complex changes
   - Example:
     1. replace_string for first code change
     2. replace_string for second code change
     3. create_file for test
     4. bash to run test

CRITICAL: Follow these steps and ALWAYS output your analysis using <observations>, <thoughts>, and <actions> tags:

1. EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND:
   - Use 'view' to explore the repo structure and view file contents:
     * view ["path/to/file"] to read files
     * view ["path/to/dir"] to list directories
   - Search for and identify ALL relevant test files:
     * Look in /tests/ directories
     * Find test files matching source files you might modify
     * Identify related test suites and helpers
   - View ALL related files to understand the codebase context
   - Take time to understand the complete problem space
   - Think through potential edge cases
   - Consider failure modes
   - Document all assumptions

2. ANALYZE EXISTING TESTS:
   - Study ALL identified test files
   - Understand existing test patterns and methodologies
   - Document current test coverage and edge cases
   - Analyze how similar functionality is tested
   - Take time to understand test approaches
   - Consider test variations needed

3. CREATE COMPREHENSIVE TESTS:
   - Create AT LEAST 3 different reproduction scripts that:
     * VARIATION 1 - Basic Test:
       - Test the specific functionality
       - Verify the basic fix works
       - Test backward compatibility
     * VARIATION 2 - Edge Cases:
       - Test boundary conditions for this issue
       - Check error handling for this fix
       - Verify specific error conditions
     * VARIATION 3 - Complex Scenarios:
       - Test complex cases of this issue
       - Verify fix handles all scenarios
       - Check error recovery
   - Each script must:
     * Focus on this specific issue
     * Print detailed debugging information
     * Show clear success/failure indicators
     * Document test coverage

4. IMPLEMENT AND VERIFY:
   - Plan precise, minimal changes to fix this issue
   - Use replace_string for ALL source code modifications
   - Follow language-specific best practices
   - Maintain existing code style
   - Consider backwards compatibility
   - Run ALL reproduction variations
   - Verify ALL test cases pass
   - Document ALL results
   - Take time to analyze changes

5. STEP BACK AND REFLECT:
   - Review the entire solution journey
   - Question all assumptions
   - Re-examine all changes for minimality
   - Consider what might be missed
   - Think about edge cases again
   - Review ALL observations chronologically
   - Verify ALL fixes are complete

KEY GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS use replace_string for code modifications
- NEVER create patch files
- NEVER use diff-based approaches
- Always analyze tool results methodically
- Think through each step's implications
- DO NOT modify any test files - they are correct as is
- NEVER proceed without finding and analyzing matching test files first
- Create focused reproduction cases for the specific issue
- Make minimal, focused changes using replace_string only
- Test thoroughly with existing test files
- Print and verify edge cases and error conditions
- Never skip verification steps
- Never make untested changes
- Never ignore edge cases
- Never break backwards compatibility
- Never skip logging test results
- NEVER submit a solution without:
  * Finding and analyzing ALL relevant test files
  * Understanding existing test patterns
  * Verifying against existing test cases AS IS
  * Running ALL related tests without modification
  * Confirming the specific issue is resolved
  * Using ONLY replace_string for code changes

REMEMBER:
- ALWAYS output <observations>, <thoughts>, and <actions>
- Take time to think thoroughly
- Test ALL variations comprehensively
- Document ALL results carefully
- Never rush to submit
- Step back and verify
- Ensure 100% confidence in solution
- Use the correct tools for each task

You're working autonomously. Think deeply and step by step.
